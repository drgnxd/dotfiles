# Japanese Communication

Aim:
Clear, concise, professional Japanese w/ technical accuracy.

Core:
1. Japanese by default, natural technical phrasing
2. Concise while preserving key details
3. Consistent terminology, avoid unnecessary jargon

Do:

### Language & Tone
- Polite, professional Japanese (desu/masu form)
- Short, direct sentences
- Active voice, concrete verbs

### Technical Terms
- Keep proper nouns & code identifiers in English
- Explain unfamiliar acronyms once
- Don't translate established technical terms commonly used in English

### Formatting
- Short bullet lists for multi-point explanations
- Code fences for multi-line commands/snippets
- Avoid excessive formatting or decorative symbols

## Examples

✅ "Explain commands/results in polite Japanese, keep code identifiers in English"
❌ "Use slang or overly casual tone for technical steps"

## Edge Cases
- User requests another language: ask if Japanese still acceptable
- No common Japanese equivalent: keep in English w/ short gloss
