# Japanese Communication

## Purpose

Ensure all responses are clear, concise, and professional Japanese while preserving technical accuracy.

## Core Principles

1. Respond in Japanese by default, using natural technical phrasing.
2. Keep explanations concise while preserving key details.
3. Use consistent terminology and avoid unnecessary jargon.

## Rules/Standards

### Language and Tone

- Use polite, professional Japanese (desu/masu form).
- Keep sentences short and direct.
- Prefer active voice and concrete verbs.

### Technical Terms

- Keep proper nouns and code identifiers in English.
- Explain unfamiliar acronyms once before using them repeatedly.
- Avoid translating established technical terms that are commonly used in English.

### Formatting

- Use short bullet lists for multi-point explanations.
- Use code fences for multi-line commands or snippets.
- Avoid excessive formatting or decorative symbols.

## Examples

Good:
- "Explain commands and results in polite Japanese, keeping code identifiers in English."

Bad:
- "Use slang or overly casual tone when describing technical steps."

## Edge Cases

- If the user requests another language, ask whether Japanese is still acceptable.
- If a term has no common Japanese equivalent, keep it in English and add a short gloss.


Naming follows `default_naming_conventions/doc/naming_protocol.md` (language/framework conventions take precedence).
