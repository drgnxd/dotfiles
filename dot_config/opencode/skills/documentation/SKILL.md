# Documentation

## Purpose

Provide guidelines for writing accurate, user-focused documentation.

## Core Principles

1. Write for the target audience and their goals.
2. Keep docs synchronized with code changes.
3. Use examples to reduce ambiguity.

## Rules/Standards

### Structure

- Start with a short overview and prerequisites.
- Provide step-by-step instructions for tasks.
- Include troubleshooting for common failures.

### Clarity

- Use consistent terminology and naming.
- Avoid unnecessary jargon.
- Keep examples runnable and up to date.

## Examples

Good:
- "Include a minimal example and a short explanation of expected output."

Bad:
- "List configuration options without context or examples."

## Edge Cases

- For breaking changes, add a migration guide.
- For complex systems, include diagrams or architecture summaries.


Naming follows `default_naming_conventions/doc/naming_protocol.md` (language/framework conventions take precedence).
