# Skills Creator

Aim:
- author short, consistent SKILLs; move long examples to `doc/`

Core:
- YAML front matter; Aim/Core/Do/Edge sections; English; relative `doc/` links

Do:
- keep SKILL.md terse (<500 lines); place examples/patterns/templates in `doc/`
- centralize external URLs in `meta_skill/doc/refs.md`

Edge:
- heavy templates or multiple examples belong only in `doc/` (not SKILL.md)

Refs: See doc/refs.md
