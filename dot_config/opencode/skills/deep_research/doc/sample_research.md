# Sample Research Summary

## Topic

GraphQL vs REST for internal APIs

## Scope

- Performance characteristics
- Developer experience
- Tooling maturity

## Summary

This sample summarizes how a structured comparison can be organized. It is intentionally brief and should be expanded for real research outputs.

## Findings

- GraphQL reduces over-fetching but can increase server complexity.
- REST remains simpler to cache and monitor at scale.
- Ecosystem maturity favors REST for legacy integrations, while GraphQL has stronger tooling for schema governance.

## Recommendations

- Use GraphQL for client-driven query flexibility and schema governance needs.
- Use REST for simpler integrations and predictable caching.
