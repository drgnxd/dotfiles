# Source Evaluation

Use the CRAAP framework to score each source. Record scores and confidence in your findings log.

## CRAAP Criteria

- **Currency**: How recent is the information?
- **Relevance**: Does it directly address the research question?
- **Authority**: Is the author or publisher credible?
- **Accuracy**: Are claims supported by evidence?
- **Purpose**: Is the source objective, or does it have bias?

## Scoring Guidance

Each criterion scores 0-2 points.

- **0**: Weak or unknown

- **2**: Strong and well-supported

Total score ranges from 0-10.

- **8-10**: High confidence
- **6-7**: Medium confidence
