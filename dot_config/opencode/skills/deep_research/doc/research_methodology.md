# Research Methodology

This guide describes the five-phase workflow used by the deep research skill.

## Phase 1: Scope Definition

- Define the primary research question and 2-5 subquestions.
- Record success criteria, constraints, and expected deliverables.
- Use [research plan template](research_plan_template.md).

## Phase 2: Initial Search

- Design primary and secondary keywords.
- Create 3-5 query variants to widen coverage.
- Capture at least 10-15 sources across categories.
- Record author, date, and source type.

## Phase 3: Deep Dive

- Prioritize topics with high importance and high uncertainty.
- Perform citation chaining for critical claims.
- Triangulate with at least three independent sources.
- Capture controversies and opposing views.

## Phase 4: Synthesis

- Group findings by themes.
- Identify patterns and trends.
- Document knowledge gaps and confidence levels.
- Use [findings template](findings_template.md).

## Phase 5: Reporting

- Produce a structured report with methodology, findings, and recommendations.
- Include risks, limitations, and references.
- Use [final report template](final_report_template.md).

## Quality Checklist

- Multiple independent sources per key claim.
- Primary sources prioritized when available.
- Recency and authority recorded for each source.
- Conflicting evidence noted and explained.
- Limitations and gaps explicitly documented.
