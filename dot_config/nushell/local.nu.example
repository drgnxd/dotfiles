# Local Nushell overrides (unmanaged by Home Manager)
#
# Usage:
#   cp ~/.config/nix-config/dot_config/nushell/local.nu.example ~/.config/nushell/local.nu
#
# This file is intentionally not symlinked by Home Manager, so each machine can
# keep private or host-specific settings here.

# Example: override default flake target on this machine
# $env.DOTFILES_FLAKE_TARGET = "macbook"

# Example: prepend a machine-local tool path
# $env.PATH = ($env.PATH | prepend "/opt/custom/bin" | uniq)
