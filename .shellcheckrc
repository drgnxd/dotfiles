# SC1090: Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location.
# Reason: We dynamically construct paths to source common.sh
disable=SC1090

# SC2312: Consider invoking this command separately to avoid masking its return value.
# Reason: We use strict mode (set -euo pipefail) which fails on command substitution errors
